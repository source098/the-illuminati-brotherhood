 <h3>The Five Great Principles</h3>
 <p><strong>Brotherly Love:</strong> Every true member of the Illuminati will show
tolerance and respect for the opinions of others and will behave with kindness and respect towards others like himself.</p>
 <p><strong>Relief:</strong> Illuminati members are taught to practice charity and
care, not only for themselves but for the community as a whole, either through charitable donations or or volunteer efforts and work as individuals.</p>
 <p><strong>TRUE:</strong> Illuminati members fight for the truth, demanding high moral standards and trying to merge them in their lives.</p>
 <p><strong>Confidence:</strong> Each Illuminati brother will be required to trust the
organization, his brothers, his supervisors and himself. He will have to work without doubts and skepticism, for doubt and skepticism kill the spirit of the Brotherhood.</p>
 <p><strong>Gravity:</strong> Every member is expected to show some level of
seriousness towards the work of the Illuminati.</p>
